## **🔧 Implementation Status**

### **✅ Updated Files:**
1. **streamlit_app.py** - Main extraction logic updated
2. **booking_com_parser.py** - T-Booking.com parser updated
3. **agoda_parser.py** - T-Agoda parser updated

### **🎯 Room Type Extraction Logic:**
```python
# Priority-based matching for accurate room code assignment
if 'Superior Room with One King Bed' in room_type or ('Superior' in room_type and 'King' in room_type):
    extracted['ROOM'] = 'SK'
elif 'Superior Room with Two Twin Beds' in room_type or ('Superior' in room_type and 'Twin' in room_type):
    extracted['ROOM'] = 'ST'
elif 'Studio with One King Bed' in room_type or 'Studio' in room_type:
    extracted['ROOM'] = 'SA'  # Corrected from STK to SA
# ... etc
```

### **📊 Key Corrections Made:**
- **Studio with One King Bed**: `STK` → **`SA`** ✅
